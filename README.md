# straitforword
this is my prototype game for class i used lots of info from GitHub and YouTube videos this was my first ever code in c# 
so I very much struggled with this project i followed along on videos but ultamently 
i was able to make a pretty cool follow up to space invaders where the humans invade the alian planet 

 the video on canvas helped out alot but i also refrenced some other youtube videos.
